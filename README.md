# AI Smart Glass
It is well known that visually challenged as well as old aged people find it 
difficult to properly recognize any object or person . Priorily walking sticks 
with sensors have been used to tackle the problem but the method failed to 
perform in certain situations as it is not capable of detecting the object or 
person incoming nor were they able to differentiate between living and non 
living strategy.
The project aims in designing AI BASED Face recognition and object 
detection glasses . This will not only help to recognize the familiar faces but 
also will warn if obstacles are near so that no harm is caused to the person.
The face recognition shall be done through a predefined library developed 
using programming languages. System learns about the obstacles and alerts 
the user with warning using ultrasonic sensors
